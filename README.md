# curiesphere_qgis

Some protoypes of QGIS plugins to allow generation of lithospheric magnetic field models using QGIS menus. 

All plugins will rely on having the code from the curiesphere repo installed and functioning in a python environment on the local machine (but not the QGIS native python env)
